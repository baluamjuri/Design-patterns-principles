Single Responsibility - A class should only have one responsibility
Open/Closed - classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution - if class A is a subtype of class B, we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program
Interface Segregation - larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones
Dependency Inversion - The principle of dependency inversion refers to the decoupling of software modules. This way, instead of high-level modules depending on low-level modules, both will depend on abstractions.
